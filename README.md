# Blockchain Simulation 
A blockchain simulation developed that can simulate the behavior of a real-world blockchain and how transactions are processed in it.  

# Security Implementation 
- RSA-2048 Key Generation
- SHA-256 hash function for blocks and transaction signatures
- Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism
